The solution involves carefully adjusting the CSS specificity to ensure the desired pseudo-element styles are applied.  One way to fix this is to remove the conflicting selector, or make the `div::before` selector more specific, ensuring its specificity is higher than the conflicting class selector's specificity.

Here's a corrected version:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

/*Increased specificity by adding an id selector.  This is one approach.  Removing the conflicting selector is another.*/
#myDiv::before {
  content: "Hello!";
  color: red;
}

<div id="myDiv" class="specific-class">This is some text</div>
```

Alternatively, remove `.specific-class::before` completely if it's not needed.
