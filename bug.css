The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon issue where a pseudo-element's content is unexpectedly not displayed due to incorrect specificity or an unexpected cascade of styles.  The :before pseudo-element should add the text "Hello!" before the content of the element, but does not due to the conflicting specificity of another selector.

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

div::before {
  content: "Hello!";
  color: red;
}

.specific-class::before {
  content: ""; /* Empties the content by setting it to an empty string */
}

<div class="specific-class">This is some text</div>
```
